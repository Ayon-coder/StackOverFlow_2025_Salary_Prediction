    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook successfully demonstrates a complete workflow for predicting yearly compensation from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025 data using linear regression. Key insights include the importance of thorough data preprocessing, such as handling missing values, feature engineering (e.g., exploding programming languages and simplifying categories), and filtering to top categories to focus on representative data. The model achieves a reasonable fit for general trends, with evaluation metrics (MAE and R²) indicating moderate predictive power, though performance is hindered by salary outliers and skewed distributions, as evidenced by the scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample prediction illustrates practical application, estimating a salary of approximately $XX,XXX for a developer with 5 years of experience, 9 years coding, based in India, using Python, with a bachelor's degree, in fintech, as a full-stack developer, and employed full-time. Overall, the analysis highlights linear regression's limitations for high-income predictions and suggests potential improvements like log-transforming the target variable, addressing outliers, or exploring more advanced models (e.g., random forests or gradient boosting) for better accuracy in future iterations."
